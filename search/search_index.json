The public consists in potential donors, and each donor has a panel with a number written on it. After a pitch, the host ask the audience if they would like to donate: interested donors then raise their panels if they want to do so. The host then recites the number on every raised panels. In the meantime, there is someone backstage who actually writes down the numbers. The idea of this project is to develop an algorithm that automatically detects raised panels and their respective numbers.</p> <p>Below is an illustration of the current status of the project</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"about/#contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>We welcome contributions from the community!</p>"},{"location":"about/#license","title":"License","text":"<p>This project is licensed under the MIT license.

They all vary in length and overall quality I'd say. They are quite diverse, in the the sense that sometimes it's taken from the back of the venue, sometimes from the stage, and sometimes from the side. That makes a good set of different examples though.</p>"},{"location":"data/#extracting-frames","title":"Extracting frames","text":"<p>Extracting individual frames from each sequence has been done with this simple ffmpeg command:</p> <pre><code>ffmpeg -i {video_file} {dir_with_frames}/{sequence_name}-frame%04d.png\n</code></pre> <p>WARNING: The <code>{dir_with_frames}</code> should exist before running the command.</p> <p>There is a grand total of 14932 frames, with quite some redundancy (which is normal, since it's video sequences). I deliberately chose not to eliminate some, but I'm quite aware that this dataset is somehow not optimal because of that.</p>"},{"location":"data/#getting-annotations","title":"Getting annotations","text":"<p>For each frame, an annotation file has been generated as a csv file. Each csv file contains one or several lines, i.e. one line for each detected panel. Here's an example of the content of such a csv file:</p> <pre><code>20,974,833,1075,899\n861,2987,986,3143,1088\n</code></pre> <p>The first number is the detected number on the panel and the four remaining numbers are the coordinates of the bounding box as [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax].</p> <p>These detections have been automatically made using a fine-tuned Faster R-CNN for the bounding box detection and with the OCR Tamil package for recognizing the numbers inside each panel.</p>"},{"location":"data/#unusable-images","title":"Unusable images","text":"<p>In some images, no panels can be detected. Consequently no csv file is generated for such images. This can happen for various reasons (an obvious one is that there is actually no panels in the image). Here's for instance an example of a blurry image where no panels are detected:</p> <p> </p> <p>Of the 14932 images in total, there are 1579 in which no panels are detected. This leaves us with 13353 usable frames.</p>"},{"location":"data/#final-annotations","title":"Final annotations","text":"<p>There are cases where detected numbers are wrong (i.e. the number is not correctly recognized and does not correspond to the one written on the panel). Such cases have been automatically detected in the generated annotation files and simply removed from the annotations.</p> <p>In particular, lines of the csv file where:</p> <ul> <li>The \"number\" contains a character different than a numeric</li> <li>The number is higher than 1000 (this can happen when two panels are close and side-by-side) or lower than zero.</li> </ul> <p>have been removed from the annotation file. They have not been corrected, since this would have required way too much effort (visual validation). </p> <p>Here's an example of a faulty detection where two panels are side-by-side:</p> <p> </p> <p>Note that this may cause issues for future evaluations, since the ground truth is de facto not exact.

After the (rough) validation of the automatically generated annotations, we have 11111 remaining annotation files.
